You just had a website built using WordPress…awesome!  Now it’s time for you to manage and update your site.   For someone who has used WordPress in the past they can tell you how easy it is to get started.  However, upon your first log-in to the dashboard, it can be a bit overwhelming.  There are lots of buttons and areas for you to explore and it is much easier to learn the ropes with an experienced guide.

Designs 4 The Web offers a number of  WordPress training options ranging from the very basics of getting started to advanced customization of your theme.  The training is also scaleable meaning it can be done for one individual who has been designated the go to person for the website or for hundreds of employees through the use of a training module website.  For a glimpse into these video tutorials, check out the WordPress tips and tricks video tutorial series from our <a title="Designs 4 The Web on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Designs4TheWebLLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Channel</a>.

I basically had little to no Word Press knowledge prior to our training session but by the end I felt confident that I could handle the day to day updating that we required.  I will be reaching out to Mike in the future to expand my knowledge of our site to maximize our sites potential to our members."</p>

	<h3>How Do I Hire a WordPress trainer?</h3>
If you are looking for WordPress training in Connecticut, there are several considerations.  First and foremost, you will want to work with someone who knows the ins and outs of WordPress.  For example, all of the sites that we setup come with a personalized setup that brands their dashboard and removes any unnecessary functionality so that there is less to navigate.  This is something that has gotten very good reviews.  You will also want to make sure that the WordPress training is available at times when your staff will need training.  We have found that our personalized tutorial videos are excellent for small businesses who want to be able to learn at their own pace on their own time.  Of course you will also want to think about cost when looking for someone offering WordPress training.  It is our belief that the client is entitled to training as part of the development of the site so it is included in the cost of the site development.

With over a decade of instructional design and teaching experience, Designs 4 The Web is highly skilled in the area of staff development and WordPress training.  Whether you are just learning about WordPress or already have a site that needs to be managed, we can offer you the training and assistance to leverage the unlimited potential of your WordPress website.  <a title="Contact Designs 4 The Web" href="https://www.designs4theweb.com/contact-d4tw">Contact us</a> today or give us a call at 203.516.0359 to learn more about how we can get you started.
